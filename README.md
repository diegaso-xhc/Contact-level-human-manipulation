# Contact-level-human-manipulation

❮img src= "Visualizations/vis_1.png"❯

This repository contains algorithms to better analyze human hand-object manipulation interactions

Here I intend to not only show an overview of the algorithms, but also show off a little bit.

I also want to learn how to show off using github. This will help me in the future for my future projects and career.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
