# Contact-level-human-manipulation
This repository contains algorithms to better analyze human hand-object manipulation interactions

Here I intend to not only show an overview of the algorithms, but also show off a little bit.

I also want to learn how to show off using github. This will help me in the future for my future projects and career.
